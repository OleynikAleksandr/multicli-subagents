# Changelog

All notable changes to **SubAgent Manager** are documented here.

## [0.0.23] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed
- **Clean Orchestrator Output** — Added `2>/dev/null` to all SubAgent commands (both Codex and Claude vendors)
  
  **Problem:** When the Main Orchestrator Agent invoked a SubAgent, it received the entire output stream including:
  - Internal `thinking` blocks (agent reasoning)
  - `exec` command logs with full shell output
  - Intermediate messages and debugging information
  
  This polluted the orchestrator's context window and made it difficult to parse the actual SubAgent response.
  
  **Solution:** All SubAgent commands now redirect stderr to `/dev/null`, ensuring the orchestrator receives **only the final answer** (stdout), not internal processing logs.

- **Command Regeneration on Deploy** — Commands are now regenerated during every deploy operation
  
  Previously, commands stored in the Library were used as-is during deploy. If an agent was created before this fix, its commands would still lack `2>/dev/null`. Now, commands are always regenerated from the centralized `command-generator.ts`, guaranteeing the latest format.

- **Codex Resume Command** — Added missing `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` flag to `codex exec resume` command

### Added
- `src/core/command-generator.ts` — Centralized command generator for consistent command format across all deploy operations
